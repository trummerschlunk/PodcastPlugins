...so you are actually hearing my voice now through PodcastPlugins.

Hi, my name is Klaus. I am a mix and mastering engineer and I have been mixing a looot of vocal and speech performances in the past 20 years.

and I love podcasts!

well, the good sounding ones.

but here's the problem: the quality of the content and the sound quality do not necessarily correlate.

actually: it's often the opposite.

So let's change that.

I decided to put my knowledge of how to make vocals sound good into a set of super easy to use audio plugins called PoscastPlugins.

And by the way, it's free and open source!

Let's load it up and listen before and after:

Hi, my name is Julia and I am a Berlin based content creator for the wonderful jazz label ACT.

Hi, my name is Markus. I am a digital activist and I recorded my first podcast in the year 2000.

Hi, my name is Linn. Among other things, I teach digital literacy and AI for students around the world.

Hi, my name is Toni and soon I will be a  digital content creator.

Please check out PodcastPlugins yourself and give them a try. I hope they help you make great sounding content, even without any audio engineering knowlede.

So I can go back to mixing now ;)

BYE!
