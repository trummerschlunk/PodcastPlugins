...so you are actually hearing my voice now through PodcastPlugins.

Listen in headphones for best experience!

Hi, my name is Klaus. I am a mix and mastering engineer and I have been mixing a looot of vocal and speech performances in the past 20 years.

and I love podcasts!

well, the good sounding ones.

but here's the problem: the quality of the content and the sound quality do not necessarily correlate.

actually: it's often the opposite.

So let's change that.

I decided to put my knowledge of how to make vocals sound good into a set of super easy to use audio plugins called PoscastPlugins.

//And by the way, it's free and open source!

Let's load it up and listen before and after:

1. What is it
2. easy to use
3. Free and open source
4. Cross platform
