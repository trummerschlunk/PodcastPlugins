Podcast Plugins are under development. The first release is scheduled for 1st of March 2025.

Podcast Plugins are easy to use plugins for speech enhancement, specifically designed for podcasters who can't or don't want to dig deeper into the craft of sound engineering.
The bundle consists of two plugins:
